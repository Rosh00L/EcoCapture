( ) would absolutely discourage little room error . also take bus liptons seat ( get haputale ) take tuk tuk . view top lipton statue pretty show tea plantation every direction . either walk back entrance ( ) catch bus meet ride simply ride back tuk tuk look around . place along way ( walk rid ) look around wander bit row tea plant . go early - roll around tell get bad enough later day drive difficult . give road risk ever want take ! also people often take picture tea ladies work remember - pay equivalent less $ usd day animal zoo perform entertainment .&quot;</bucket>
